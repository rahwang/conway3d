# conway3d
A procedural music generator written in javascript.
Conway mode:
  Cells are marked alive and dead according the rules of Conway's Game of Life. Cells surviving to the 10th generation produce a tone dependent on position.
Free play mode:
  Users can add cells moving in either the x or z direction. Cells produce tones on collision with grid boundaries.
